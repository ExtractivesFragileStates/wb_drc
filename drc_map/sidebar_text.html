	<h1>Security</h1>
	
	<p>Since the end of the Second Congo War in '03, the DRC continues to experience chronic instability around the country.  This conflict density map layer aggregates violent incidents captured by the ACLED database taking place between '08 and '10.  Violence is concentrated in the eastern <span class='navigate'>Kivu provinces</span>, where local militias and rebel groups fund their activities in part through the black market trade in <b>conflict minerals</b>.  Conflict density is also high in the north east of Oriental Province, where the <b>Lords Resistance Army</b>, led by Joseph Kony, continues to terrorize local populations.</p>

	<h1>Land Rights</h1>
	<p>Ethnic tensions over land rights, inflamed by the country's two successive civil wars, are a major flash point for violence, often resulting in a cycle reprisals and the creation of ethnic-based civilian militias.  The situation is further aggrevated by conflicts between customary and official land claims, which given the weakness of both customary and state structures, often results in corrupt practices and inter-communal violence.  Mediation between small landholders with competing claims has had some successes in resolving these confrontations, however comprehensive landreform remains as a massive undertaking.</p>

	<h1>M23</h1>
	
	<p>In early spring, '12, nearly 300 soldiers recently integrated into the Congolese Army (FARDC) rebelled against the government, calling their movement M23.  Active mainly in <span class='navigate'>North Kivu province</span>, the group grew over the subsequent year, and in Fall '12 succeeded in capturing the eastern boarder city of Goma.  In March '13, Bosco Ntaganda, the leader of M23 who was wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, surrendered to the US Embacy in Kigali, likely due to infighting in the group.  Since then, the group's power has declined, though instability in the east remains endemic.</p>
